                <h2>About SDG 14</h2>
                <p>Sustainable Development Goal 14 aims to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources. Oceans cover over 70% of our planet and are critical for sustaining life on Earth. They provide us with food, energy, and water, and they are home to a diverse range of species. However, human activities have put immense pressure on these vital ecosystems, leading to overfishing, pollution, and habitat destruction.</p>

                    <div class="fact">Coral reefs, which support a quarter of all marine species, are being damaged by ocean acidification, warming temperatures, and pollution. About 50% of the world's coral reefs have been lost in the last 30 years.</div>
                    <div class="fact">Approximately 90% of the worldâ€™s fish stocks are fully exploited, overexploited, or depleted, threatening food security and livelihoods.</div>
                    <div class="fact">There are over 400 ocean dead zones, areas with very low oxygen levels, primarily caused by pollution from agriculture and wastewater.</div>
                    <div class="fact">Mangroves, which protect coastlines and support marine biodiversity, are disappearing three to five times faster than overall global forest losses.</div>
                    <div class="fact">Over 3 billion people depend on marine and coastal biodiversity for their livelihoods. Marine fisheries directly or indirectly employ over 200 million people.</div>
                    <div class="fact">Global sea levels have risen by about 8 inches (20 cm) since 1880, primarily due to melting ice sheets and glaciers and thermal expansion of seawater as it warms.</div>
